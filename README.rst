Introduction
------------

Yenta is YEt 'Nother TAskrunner; it executes a pipeline, defined by a series of tasks and dependencies among them.
The goal of Yenta is to provide a reasonable feature set while maintaining simplicity and usability as both a
library and a command-line tool.

The name "Yenta" is an old Yiddish name; in the American Yiddish theater of the 30s, a character named Yenta
was depicted as a busy-body, so the name became a byword for someone who won't mind their own business.


Usage
_____

Yenta can be used as a library or invoked from the command line.
